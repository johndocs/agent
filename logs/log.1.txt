This project demonstrates how to create an AI agent that can use tools to interact with a file system. It uses the Anthropic SDK for Go to communicate with Claude 3.7 Sonnet and implements two primary tools: `list_files` and `read_file`, allowing Claude to browse and read files on the local system while maintaining a conversation with the user.

The application features a simple terminal-based interface and can operate either interactively or with predefined prompts supplied as command-line arguments.

## Project Overview: Go-based Claude Agent with File System Tools

This is a Go programming project that demonstrates how to build a command-line AI agent powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. The agent can interact with the local file system through defined tools while maintaining a conversational interface with users.

### Key Components

#### 1. Main Application Files
- **main.go**: The core implementation containing:
  - The `Agent` struct and its methods for managing conversation flow
  - Tool definitions for file system interactions (`read_file` and `list_files`)
  - JSON schema generation for tool definitions
  - The main execution loop handling user input and Claude responses

- **utils.go**: Contains utility functions for:
  - Context handling with signal cancellation for graceful shutdown
  - Debug logging and JSON content description
  - Prompt saving functionality

#### 2. Go Module Configuration
- **go.mod**: Defines the module and its dependencies:
  - Primary dependencies:
    - `github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go v1.6.2`: Official Anthropic SDK
    - `github.com/invopop/jsonschema v0.13.0`: Used for generating tool schemas
  - Uses Go version 1.23.4

- **go.sum**: Contains cryptographic checksums for all dependencies

#### 3. Shell Script
- **run.sh**: Bash script that:
  - Runs the Go application twice with debug mode enabled
  - Compares the outputs between runs to demonstrate output variation
  - Maintains logs of standard output and standard error
  - Uses a consistent set of prompts for testing

#### 4. Logs Directory
- Contains log files from previous runs including:
  - Standard output logs (`log.1.txt`, `log.2.txt`)
  - Standard error logs (`log.e.1.txt`, `log.e.2.txt`)
  - Diff files showing differences between runs

### Implementation Details

#### Tool Functionality
The agent implements two file system tools:

1. **read_file**: 
   - Reads the contents of a specified file
   - Takes a relative file path as input
   - Returns the file contents as a string

2. **list_files**:
   - Lists files and directories at a given path
   - Takes an optional path parameter (defaults to current directory)
   - Returns a JSON array of file paths
   - Includes logic to skip hidden files and log files

#### Application Flow
1. The application initializes an Anthropic client
2. It sets up a user input mechanism (command-line args or interactive input)
3. The agent runs in a loop:
   - It reads user input
   - Sends messages to Claude
   - Processes Claude's responses:
     - Shows text responses to the user
     - Executes tool requests when Claude invokes a tool
     - Returns tool results back to Claude
4. The loop continues until the user terminates the program

#### Additional Features
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles termination signals for clean exits
- **Debug Mode**: Optional logging activated with the `-d` flag
- **Prompt Saving**: User inputs are saved to a file for reference
- **Colorized Output**: Uses terminal color codes to distinguish between user, Claude, and tool interactions

### Purpose
This project serves as a practical example of how to build an AI agent with tool-use capabilities, demonstrating:
1. How to define and implement tools for Claude to use
2. How to properly format tool schemas for the Anthropic API
3. How to manage the back-and-forth conversation flow
4. How to integrate Claude with an external system (file system)

The project appears to be an implementation of concepts described in a tutorial called "How to Build an Agent" from ampcode.com.
[94mYou[0m: [93mClaude[0m: ## Summary

This Go project demonstrates how to build a command-line agent that uses the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and the official Anthropic Go SDK to interact with a local file system.

The agent uses an `Agent` struct to manage the conversation and tool execution.

Key implementation details for Go developers include:

* **Tool Definition**: The agent defines two tools for Claude to use: `list_files` and `read_file`. It uses the `github.com/invopop/jsonschema` library to generate the necessary JSON schemas for these tool definitions.
* **API Integration**: The project uses `github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go` (v1.6.2) to communicate with the Claude API.
* **Execution Loop**: The core logic handles the back-and-forth between the user and the model. When Claude requests a tool, the Go application executes the file system operation, sends the result back to the model, and then Claude uses that information to formulate its final response to the user.
* **User Interface**: The application provides a simple, color-coded terminal interface for the chat. It can accept initial prompts as command-line arguments or interactively.

The project also includes features like graceful shutdown handling, debug logging, and a run script that demonstrates the variability in Claude's responses by executing the same prompts twice and comparing the outputs.
