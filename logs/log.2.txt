## Project Overview: Go-based Claude Agent with File System Tools

This is a Go programming project that demonstrates how to build a command-line AI agent powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. The project allows the agent to interact with a local file system through defined tools while maintaining a conversational interface with users.

### Key Components

1. **Main Application (main.go)**
   - Implements the core `Agent` struct that manages the conversation
   - Defines two file system tools: `read_file` and `list_files`
   - Handles the conversation flow and tool execution
   - Uses the official Anthropic SDK for Go

2. **Utilities (utils.go)**
   - Provides context handling with signal cancellation for graceful shutdown
   - Implements debug logging and content description
   - Manages JSON key counting for monitoring API responses
   - Includes prompt saving functionality

3. **Go Module Configuration**
   - Uses Anthropic SDK and jsonschema libraries
   - Manages dependencies through go.mod and go.sum

4. **Shell Script (run.sh)**
   - Runs the application twice to demonstrate output variations
   - Compares outputs using diff
   - Maintains logs of executions

5. **Logs Directory**
   - Contains log files from previous runs
   - Includes standard output and error logs
   - Demonstrates variation in Claude's responses

### Tool Implementation

The agent implements two primary tools:

1. **read_file**: Reads the contents of a specified file
   - Takes a relative file path as input
   - Returns the file contents as a string

2. **list_files**: Lists files and directories at a given path
   - Takes an optional path parameter (defaults to current directory)
   - Returns a JSON array of file paths
   - Includes logic to skip hidden files and log files

### Application Flow

1. The application initializes the Anthropic client
2. It sets up user input handling (either from command-line arguments or interactive input)
3. The agent runs in a conversation loop where it:
   - Reads user input
   - Sends messages to Claude
   - Processes Claude's responses (text or tool invocations)
   - Executes tools when requested and returns results
4. The conversation continues until the user exits

### Notable Features

- **JSON Schema Generation**: Uses reflection to generate tool schemas
- **Colorized Output**: Uses terminal colors to distinguish between user, Claude, and tool interactions
- **Signal Handling**: Gracefully handles termination signals
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Works with both interactive and batch prompts
- **Debugging Capability**: Includes detailed logging when debug mode is enabled

This project serves as a practical example of how to build an AI agent with tool-use capabilities, focusing specifically on file system interactions through a conversational interface with Claude.
[94mYou[0m: [93mClaude[0m: ## Summary

This Go project demonstrates how to build a command-line agent that uses the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and the official Anthropic Go SDK to interact with a local file system.

The agent uses an `Agent` struct to manage the conversation and tool execution.

Key implementation details for Go developers include:

* **Tool Definition**: The agent defines two tools for Claude to use: `list_files` and `read_file`. It uses the `github.com/invopop/jsonschema` library to generate the necessary JSON schemas for these tool definitions.
* **API Integration**: The project uses `github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go` (v1.6.2) to communicate with the Claude API.
* **Execution Loop**: The core logic handles the back-and-forth between the user and the model. When Claude requests a tool, the Go application executes the file system operation, sends the result back to the model, and then Claude uses that information to formulate its final response to the user.
* **User Interface**: The application provides a simple, color-coded terminal interface for the chat. It can accept initial prompts as command-line arguments or interactively.

The project also includes features for graceful shutdown handling and a run script that demonstrates the variability in Claude's responses by executing the same prompts twice and comparing the outputs.
