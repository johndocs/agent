< [93mClaude[0m: Based on the README.md, this directory contains a Go programming project that demonstrates how to build an AI agent using Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. The agent is designed to interact with a local file system through defined tools.
< 
< Key components in this directory:
< 
< 1. **Go Source Files**:
<    - `main.go`: Contains the main application code and the Agent struct
<    - `utils.go`: Contains utility functions for the application
< 
< 2. **Go Module Files**:
<    - `go.mod`: Defines the module and its dependencies
<    - `go.sum`: Contains dependency checksums
< 
< 3. **Logs Directory**:
<    - Contains log files from previous runs of the application
< 
< 4. **Shell Script**:
<    - `run.sh`: Script to execute the application
< 
< 5. **Documentation**:
<    - `README.md`: Project documentation
< 
< This project demonstrates how to create an AI agent that can use tools to interact with a file system. It uses the Anthropic SDK for Go to communicate with Claude 3.7 Sonnet and implements two primary tools: `list_files` and `read_file`, allowing Claude to browse and read files on the local system while maintaining a conversation with the user.
< 
< The application features a simple terminal-based interface and can operate either interactively or with predefined prompts supplied as command-line arguments.

> The agent implements two primary tools:
103,107c72
< #### Tool Functionality
< The agent implements two file system tools:
< 
< 1. **read_file**: 
<    - Reads the contents of a specified file
---
> 1. **read_file**: Reads the contents of a specified file
111,112c76
< 2. **list_files**:
<    - Lists files and directories at a given path
---
> 2. **list_files**: Lists files and directories at a given path
117,121c81,86
< #### Application Flow
< 1. The application initializes an Anthropic client
< 2. It sets up a user input mechanism (command-line args or interactive input)
< 3. The agent runs in a loop:
<    - It reads user input
---
> ### Application Flow
> 
> 1. The application initializes the Anthropic client
> 2. It sets up user input handling (either from command-line arguments or interactive input)
> 3. The agent runs in a conversation loop where it:
>    - Reads user input
123,127c88,90
<    - Processes Claude's responses:
<      - Shows text responses to the user
<      - Executes tool requests when Claude invokes a tool
<      - Returns tool results back to Claude
< 4. The loop continues until the user terminates the program
---
>    - Processes Claude's responses (text or tool invocations)
>    - Executes tools when requested and returns results
> 4. The conversation continues until the user exits
129,133c92
< #### Additional Features
< - **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles termination signals for clean exits
< - **Debug Mode**: Optional logging activated with the `-d` flag
< - **Prompt Saving**: User inputs are saved to a file for reference
< - **Colorized Output**: Uses terminal color codes to distinguish between user, Claude, and tool interactions
---
> ### Notable Features
135,140c94,98
< ### Purpose
< This project serves as a practical example of how to build an AI agent with tool-use capabilities, demonstrating:
< 1. How to define and implement tools for Claude to use
< 2. How to properly format tool schemas for the Anthropic API
< 3. How to manage the back-and-forth conversation flow
< 4. How to integrate Claude with an external system (file system)

> - **Signal Handling**: Gracefully handles termination signals
> - **Dual Mode Operation**: Works with both interactive and batch prompts
> - **Debugging Capability**: Includes detailed logging when debug mode is enabled
