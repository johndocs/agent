[94mYou[0m: [93mClaude[0m: I'd be happy to create a fizzbuzz.js file for you that can be run with Node.js. Let me create this file for you now.

[93mClaude[0m: I've created a fizzbuzz.js file that you can run with Node.js. The code:

1. Defines a `fizzBuzz` function that accepts optional start and end parameters (defaulting to 1 and 100)
2. Implements the classic FizzBuzz logic:
   - Prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3
   - Prints "Buzz" for multiples of 5
   - Prints "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5
   - Prints the number otherwise
3. Executes the function automatically when the script runs

You can run this file using Node.js with the command:
```
node fizzbuzz.js
```

This will print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

[93mClaude[0m: I've updated the fizzbuzz.js file with your new requirements. The changes include:

1. Changed the range to print numbers from 12 to 26 (set as default parameters)
2. Changed the conditions to:
   - For multiples of 3: Print "Do it yourself"
   - For multiples of 4: Print "If you want something done well"
   - For multiples of both 3 and 4: Print "I am not an animal"
   - For other numbers: Print the number itself

3. Updated the function name to `modifiedFizzBuzz` to reflect these changes
4. Updated the comments to document the new behavior

You can run the modified script the same way as before:
```
node fizzbuzz.js
```

When you run it, the script will print the numbers from 12 to 26 with the special messages for multiples of 3, 4, or both.

   - Takes a number as input
   - Finds all its prime factors
   - Groups repeated factors with exponents (e.g., 2×2×2 becomes 2^3)
   - Returns a formatted string representation of the prime factorization

2. Modified the main FizzBuzz logic to:
   - Calculate the prime factors for each number
   - Append the prime factorization in square brackets at the end of each line

3. Updated the documentation to reflect the enhanced functionality

The output format is now:
- For multiples of both 3 and 5: `FizzBuzz [prime factors]`
- For multiples of 3: `Fizz [prime factors]`
- For multiples of 5: `Buzz [prime factors]`
- For other numbers: `number [prime factors]`

For example, for the number 12, it would print: `Fizz [2^2 × 3]`

You can run the enhanced script using:
```
node fizzbuzz.js
