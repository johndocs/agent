This is a Go programming project that implements an AI agent using the Anthropic Claude API. The key features and components are:

1. **Core Purpose**: This project creates an agent that allows the Claude AI model to interact with a file system through a set of tools:
   - `read_file`: For reading file contents
   - `list_files`: For listing files in directories  
   - `edit_file`: For modifying text files

2. **Main Components**:
   - `main.go`: The core implementation file containing the agent logic and tool definitions
   - `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Go module files for dependency management
   - `utils.go`: Likely contains utility functions
   - Test scripts:
     - `run_directory_contents.sh`: Tests Claude's ability to explore a directory and create a summary
     - `run_fizzbuzz.sh`: Tests Claude's ability to create and modify a JavaScript program

3. **Usage**:
   - The agent can be run in interactive chat mode
   - It can also be executed with predefined prompts (as shown in the test scripts)
   - Debug mode is available via the `-d` flag for detailed logging

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The FizzBuzz test asks Claude to create and progressively modify a JavaScript program
   - The Directory Contents test asks Claude to explore the directory structure and create a project summary

This project essentially demonstrates how AI agents can be extended with tool capabilities to interact with their environment, bridging the gap between language understanding and real-world actions.

## Project Overview

This is a Go-based project that implements an AI agent using the Anthropic Claude API. The agent allows Claude to interact with the file system through a set of provided tools.

### Core Components:

1. **Main Application (main.go)**:
   - Implements a chat agent that connects to Claude 3.7 Sonnet using the Anthropic SDK for Go
   - Defines three file operation tools for Claude to use:
     - `read_file`: Reads the contents of a specified file
     - `list_files`: Lists files in a directory
     - `edit_file`: Makes edits to text files by replacing text
   - Handles two modes: interactive chat and predefined prompts

2. **Utility Functions (utils.go)**:
   - Contains helper functions for the main application
   - Includes functions for signal handling, context management, and file operations
   - Implements debugging utilities for monitoring API calls

3. **Test Scripts**:
   - `run_directory_contents.sh`: Tests Claude's ability to explore the directory structure and create a summary
   - `run_fizzbuzz.sh`: Tests Claude's ability to progressively create and modify a JavaScript program that implements the FizzBuzz algorithm

4. **Logs Directories**:
   - `logs.directory_contents/`: Contains logs from the directory exploration test
   - `logs.fizzbuzz/`: Contains logs from the FizzBuzz programming test

### Technical Implementation:

- The agent is built using Go and the Anthropic SDK for Go
- It defines custom tool schemas for Claude using JSON Schema
- The project implements a comprehensive CLI with debug mode (`-d` flag)
- The implementation handles context cancellation for graceful shutdown

### Key Features:

1. **Tool-based Agent Architecture**: Enables Claude to interact with the file system through defined tools
2. **Interactive and Scripted Modes**: Supports both interactive chat and predefined prompt sequences
3. **Debugging Capabilities**: Detailed logging of API calls and responses
4. **Test Cases**: Demonstrates Claude's abilities with practical tests:
   - Directory exploration and summarization
   - Creating and iteratively improving JavaScript code

This project serves as an excellent example of extending AI capabilities through tools that bridge the gap between language understanding and real-world actions. It demonstrates how to implement a system where Claude can read files, explore directories, and create/modify code files, showcasing the practical applications of AI agents with environmental awareness.
