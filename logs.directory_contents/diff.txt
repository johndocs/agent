> ### Core Components:
42,45c72,75
< 1. **Go Application (main.go and utils.go)**:
<    - Creates a chat agent that connects to Claude 3.7 Sonnet using the Anthropic SDK for Go
<    - Implements tools for file operations that Claude can use:
<      - `read_file`: Reads the contents of a file
---
> 1. **Main Application (main.go)**:
>    - Implements a chat agent that connects to Claude 3.7 Sonnet using the Anthropic SDK for Go
>    - Defines three file operation tools for Claude to use:
>      - `read_file`: Reads the contents of a specified file
47,48c77,78
<      - `edit_file`: Makes edits to a text file
<    - Handles conversations, tool invocations, and user input/output
---
>      - `edit_file`: Makes edits to text files by replacing text
>    - Handles two modes: interactive chat and predefined prompts
50,52c80,83
< 2. **Shell Scripts**:
<    - `run_directory_contents.sh`: Tests the agent's ability to explore a directory and create a summary. It runs the agent with specific prompts to examine directory contents, and compares results across multiple runs to check consistency.
<    - `run_fizzbuzz.sh`: Tests the agent's ability to create and modify a JavaScript program. It creates a FizzBuzz implementation and progressively asks Claude to make modifications to it.
---
> 2. **Utility Functions (utils.go)**:
>    - Contains helper functions for the main application
>    - Includes functions for signal handling, context management, and file operations
>    - Implements debugging utilities for monitoring API calls
54,56c85,87
< 3. **Log Directories**:
<    - `logs.directory_contents/`: Contains logs from running the directory contents script
<    - `logs.fizzbuzz/`: Contains logs from running the FizzBuzz script
---
> 3. **Test Scripts**:
>    - `run_directory_contents.sh`: Tests Claude's ability to explore the directory structure and create a summary
>    - `run_fizzbuzz.sh`: Tests Claude's ability to progressively create and modify a JavaScript program that implements the FizzBuzz algorithm
57a89,99
> 4. **Logs Directories**:
>    - `logs.directory_contents/`: Contains logs from the directory exploration test
>    - `logs.fizzbuzz/`: Contains logs from the FizzBuzz programming test
> 
> ### Technical Implementation:
> 
> - The agent is built using Go and the Anthropic SDK for Go
> - It defines custom tool schemas for Claude using JSON Schema
> - The project implements a comprehensive CLI with debug mode (`-d` flag)
> - The implementation handles context cancellation for graceful shutdown

< - **Tool System**: The agent exposes tools to Claude, allowing it to read files, list directories, and make file edits
< - **Interactive Mode**: Users can chat with Claude and the agent will handle the conversation
< - **Script Mode**: The agent can take a list of prompts as arguments and run them sequentially
< - **Debugging**: Includes debugging capabilities with the `-d` flag to view detailed information about API calls and responses
---
> 1. **Tool-based Agent Architecture**: Enables Claude to interact with the file system through defined tools
> 2. **Interactive and Scripted Modes**: Supports both interactive chat and predefined prompt sequences
> 3. **Debugging Capabilities**: Detailed logging of API calls and responses
> 4. **Test Cases**: Demonstrates Claude's abilities with practical tests:
>    - Directory exploration and summarization
>    - Creating and iteratively improving JavaScript code

< 1. The agent initializes a connection to Claude using the Anthropic SDK
< 2. It defines a set of tools that Claude can use to interact with the environment
< 3. When a user sends a message, it's forwarded to Claude via the API
< 4. If Claude's response includes a tool invocation, the agent executes it and returns the result
< 5. The conversation continues with Claude having access to the tool results
